Every dance trainer who coaches a ballerina\\non how to leap uses physics. Indeed, analyzing complicated motion of any sort re-\\nquires simplification via an understanding of physics. In this chapter we discuss\\nhow the complicated motion of a system of objects, such as a car or a ballerina,\\ncan be simplified if we determine a special point of the system — the center of\\nmass of that system.\\nHere is a quick example. If you toss a ball into the air without much spin on the\\nball (Fig. 9-1a), its motion is simple — it follows a parabolic path, as we discussed in\\nChapter 4, and the ball can be treated as a particle. If, instead, you flip a baseball bat\\ninto the air (Fig. 9-1b), its motion is more complicated. Because every part of the bat\\nmoves differently, along paths of many different shapes, you cannot represent the\\nbat as a particle. Instead, it is a system of particles each of which follows its own path\\nthrough the air. However, the bat has one special point — the center of mass — that\\ndoes move in a simple parabolic path. The other parts of the bat move around the\\ncenter of mass. (To locate the center of mass, balance the bat on an outstretched fin-\\nger; the point is above your finger, on the bat’s central axis.)\\nYou cannot make a career of flipping baseball bats into the air, but you can\\nmake a career of advising long-jumpers or dancers on how to leap properly into\\nthe air while either moving their arms and legs or rotating their torso. Your\\nstarting point would be to determine the person’s center of mass because of its\\nsimple motion.\\nCHAPTER 9\\nCenter of Mass and Linear Momentum\\n9-1 CENTER OF MASS \\nAfter reading this module, you should be able to . . .\\n9.01 Given the positions of several particles along an axis or\\na plane, determine the location of their center of mass.\\n9.02 Locate the center of mass of an extended, symmetric\\nobject by using the symmetry.\\n9.03 For a two-dimensional or three-dimensional extended ob-\\nject with a uniform distribution of mass, determine the center\\nof mass by (a) mentally dividing the object into simple geomet-\\nric figures, each of which can be replaced by a particle at its\\ncenter and (b) finding the center of mass of those particles.\\n● The center of mass of a system of n particles is defined to be the point whose coordinates are given by\\nor\\nwhere M is the total mass of the system.\\nr:\\ncom /H110051\\nM /H20858\\nn\\ni/H110051\\nmi r:\\ni ,\\nxcom /H110051\\nM /H20858\\nn\\ni/H110051\\nmi xi , ycom /H110051\\nM /H20858\\nn\\ni/H110051\\nmi yi , zcom /H110051\\nM /H20858\\nn\\ni/H110051\\nmi zi ,\\nKey Idea\\nLearning Objectives'),\n",

He did so by clamping his teeth down on a bit that was at-\\ntached to the cars with a rope and then leaning backward while\\npressing his feet against the railway ties. The cars together weighed\\n700 kN (about 80 tons). Assume that he pulled with a constant\\nforce that was 2.5 times his body weight, at an upward angle u of\\n30/H11034from the horizontal. His mass was 80 kg, and he moved the cars\\nby 1.0 m.
